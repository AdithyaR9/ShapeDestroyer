Note: This program uses the JavaFX library, make sure it is downloaded and linked to your IDE properly for the program to function. 

This is a JavaFX game, which is drawn to and played on a new window on the screen, in which shapes are shown on the screen, and the player must destroy them, by left-clicking them, before them move to a new location. If the shapes move before they are click the user loses one of his three lives; the game is over when all lives are lost. There are three types of shapes in the game: square, circle, and triangle; each shape is worth a different amount.
